					<h1><b>Public Mobile: Delivering to the Digital DIY Consumer</b></h1>
					<h2></h2>
				    
                        <p align="justify">“I need to be lead by the hand!” – is a sentiment often held but not articulated by so called digital do-it-yourself-ers. There is often a dance that must take place to properly target these types of consumers. The modern marketer must know how to satisfy their desire to be autonomous, while delivering the key outcomes of enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment knowing that they did something that others paid to have done for them.</p>
                                                
                        <p align="justify">Public Mobile has the unique selling proposition of relinquishing control to customers with the expectation that they will solve problems by themselves. The business model that accompanies their positioning, is the ideal business model to examine in order to better understand what can be done from a digital marketing standpoint, to deliver the best possible experience to these consumers.</p>
                        
                        <p align="justify">The first step to creating a meaningful online experience is understanding the motivators of those who engage in digital DIY behavior. Research conducted by the Academy of Marketing Sciences1 identified two man areas of motivation for DIY consumer in general, marketplace evaluation and identity enhancement. Considering this first area with respect to the digital, the relative economic benefits and the need for customization are the DIY consumer’s primary motivators. As for identify, since craftsmanship isn’t really a concern when doing digital projects, it’s really the sense of empowerment and the membership to a community of tech savvy individuals that drives the digital DIY consumer.</p>
                        
                        <p align="justify">With these motivators clearly outlined, what follows is coming up with a strategy that delivers the outcome of accomplishment to customers. Something that differentiates the digital DIY consumer from a regular DIY consumer is that demand for content that provide clear instructions on the project steps. Offline, where craftsmanship is tactile there is sentiment to going “off-script” and using alternative methods and materials for a task. Digital tasks often have one very specific solution, and the more effective instructional content is at delivering the steps to this solution, the happier the digital DIY consumer will be.</p>
                        
                        <p align="justify">So how is Public Mobile positioned to motivate the digital DIY consumer, and how are they delivering on the outcomes of enjoyment and accomplishment? Being an alternative wireless provider that offers fully customizable plans, priced at the low end of the market, Public Mobile satisfies the relative economic benefit and need for customization sought by these consumers. Another area where the company clearly satisfied a core motivator, is with their self serve community. With this community, Public Mobile has created an exclusive crowd of digital DIYers that are able to build their identities as tech savvy individuals by helping one another. Clearly, Public Mobile’s online community and business model demonstrates an understanding of these digital DIY behavioral motivators, however they are lacking when it comes to delivering an enjoyable experience and ultimately the feeling of accomplishment.</p>
                        
                        <p align="justify">Right now setting up a phone with Public Mobile, relies completely on navigating the company’s website. Although it is certainly possible to get started without running into any problems, with the amount of information present on the site it is easy to get lost and frustrated with the experience. Manager for Public Mobile, Catalina Lopez described the company as, “Wireless made simple. A new kind of no-frills business, built on the ideals that wireless should be clear and uncomplicated”. There is no point in the consumer purchase journey that is more crucial in delivering this brand promise, then the first interaction. It needs to quickly provide the DIY consumers need for accomplishment, and in the case of Public Mobile what is lacking is quality instructional content.</p>
                        
                        <div style="float: right; width: 0px; height: 8px"></div>
                        <div style="float: right; clear: right"> <iframe style="padding: 15px" align="middle" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06R98BAVAgM" frameborder="0px" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                        
                        <p align="justify">To accompany this discussion, I have created – and I make know boasts regarding my editing skills – an instructional video for new users on how exactly to get started with Public Mobile. I have made it in such a way that leaves no room for customers to become lost and frustrated, ensuring this first digital DIY experience, is successful and deliver the key outcome of feeling accomplished. Content like this supports Public Mobiles brand promise of clear and uncomplicated wireless, and deepens the customer experience with the product. All of sudden the company has a voice, a person there to help, and this is the presence that other providers have through their call center support services, that Public Mobile lacks. A deeper and clearer interaction through this type of content delivers enjoyment to the customer and leads them to the outcome of feeling accomplished.</p>
                        
                        <p align="justify">From here anything is possible. Public Mobil could build on the existing SIM Swap campaign. Call it “Savings Swap” and show what tech related DIY projects you can do with the savings you get by switching from one of the major service providers to Public Mobile. Turning it back to the community is also an option, leveraging the 20,000+ Facebook followers to deliver this content. Perhaps a contest for who can come up with the most creative personalized phone plan, where the winner can actually use the plan if it is within reason. The strategic possibilities are endless, and they stem from the process of engaging the core motivations of the digital DIY consumer and ultimately delivering on the outcomes of enjoyment and accomplishment.</p>
